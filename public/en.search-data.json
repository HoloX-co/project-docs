Here’s a comprehensive strategy for setting it up effectively:\nRepository Structure docs-repo/\r├── README.md\r├── decisions/\r│ ├── README.md\r│ ├── ADR-0001-use-react-for-frontend.md\r│ └── ADR-template.md\r├── research/\r│ ├── README.md\r│ ├── market-analysis/\r│ └── technology-evaluations/\r├── poc/\r│ ├── README.md\r│ ├── feature-x-prototype/\r│ └── integration-test-results/\r├── architecture/\r│ ├── README.md\r│ ├── diagrams/\r│ └── system-overview.md\r├── guides/\r│ ├── onboarding.md\r│ └── contribution.md\r├── meetings/\r│ ├── README.md\r│ └── 2025-08/\r├── assets/\r│ └── images/\r└── _templates/\r├── decision-template.md\r└── research-template.md Key Components 1. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) ADRs are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 # ADR-NNNN: Title ## Status [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-NNNN](./ADR-NNNN.md)] ## Context [Describe the problem/opportunity and the forces at play] ## Decision [Describe the decision that was made] ## Consequences [Describe the resulting context after applying the decision] ## Alternatives Considered [List alternative options that were considered and why they were not chosen] ## References [Optional: List any relevant resources or related ADRs] 2. Research Documentation For research results, use consistent formatting to make findings easy to discover:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # [Research Topic] ## Overview Brief description of research objective ## Methodology How the research was conducted ## Findings Key discoveries and insights ## Recommendations Actionable next steps based on findings ## References - [Link to sources] - [Link to related research] ## Appendix Additional supporting materials 3. Proof of Concept Documentation For POCs, document both the approach and results:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 # [POC Name] ## Objective What this POC aims to validate or explore ## Implementation Brief description of how the POC was implemented ## Setup Instructions How to run/reproduce the POC ## Results Outcomes, metrics, screenshots, etc. ## Conclusions What we learned and next steps ## Code Repository Link to any code created for this POC Advanced Organization Techniques 1. Tag-based Discovery Implement a tagging system at the top of each document to improve cross-referencing:\n---\rtitle: \"Feature X Evaluation\"\rdate: 2025-08-10\rtags: [\"performance\", \"scalability\", \"frontend\"]\rrelated: [\"ADR-0005\", \"Research-Database-Options\"]\rcontributors: [\"sepehrfazeli\", \"teammate1\"]\r--- 2. Cross-Repository References Create a dedicated section in your main README to link to important documentation in other repositories:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # Project Documentation Central repository for project-wide documentation, decisions, research, and more. ## Related Repositories - [Frontend](https://github.com/org/frontend) - Main application code - [Backend](https://github.com/org/backend) - API and server implementation - [Infrastructure](https://github.com/org/infrastructure) - Deployment and DevOps ## Quick Links - [Architecture Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md) - [Latest ADRs](./decisions/) - [Onboarding Guide](./guides/onboarding.md) Recommended Tools \u0026 Integrations GitHub Pages - Enable this to create a browsable website from your markdown documentation Docsify or MkDocs - Lightweight documentation site generators that work well with GitHub Mermaid or PlantUML - For embedding diagrams directly in markdown GitHub Actions - For validating links, formatting, etc. DocToc - For generating table of contents in markdown files Out-of-the-Box Insights Knowledge Graphs: Consider implementing a visual knowledge graph that shows relationships between documents. Tools like Obsidian can help visualize these connections.\nLiving Documents: Treat documentation as “living” - schedule regular reviews to keep content fresh. Consider adding “Last reviewed” dates to critical documents.\nDecision Logs: Beyond ADRs, maintain a chronological decision log for smaller decisions that don’t warrant a full ADR.\nSearch Optimization: GitHub’s search is basic - consider implementing a custom search solution (e.g., Algolia) for your documentation site.\nDocumentation Health Metrics: Track documentation health with metrics like freshness, coverage, and usage. GitHub Actions can generate regular reports.\nOnboarding Pathways: Create curated reading paths through your documentation for different roles to help new team members get up to speed.\nDiscussion Integration: Link GitHub Discussions to relevant documentation to capture evolving conversations about topics.\nVideo Supplements: For complex topics, consider embedding short explainer videos alongside written documentation.\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this documentation strategy or provide examples of specific document types?","recommended-tools--integrations#Recommended Tools \u0026amp; Integrations":"","repository-setup-recommendations#Repository Setup Recommendations":""},"title":"ADR-0001: Documentation Strategy"},"/project-docs/guides/":{"data":{"guides#Guides":"GuidesThis section contains how-to guides, onboarding documentation, and contribution guidelines."},"title":"Guides"},"/project-docs/meetings/":{"data":{"meeting-documentation#Meeting Documentation":"Meeting DocumentationThis section contains meeting notes, minutes, and action items organized by date."},"title":"Meetings"},"/project-docs/meetings/2025-08/":{"data":{"august-2025-meetings#August 2025 Meetings":"","files-in-this-section#Files in this Section":"August 2025 MeetingsThis section contains meeting documentation for August 2025.\nMeeting Notes Format Please use the following format for meeting notes:\nDate: YYYY-MM-DD Attendees: List of participants Agenda: Meeting topics Discussion: Key points discussed Action Items: Tasks assigned with owners and due dates Next Steps: Follow-up actions Files in this Section Add meeting notes files here following the naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-topic.md","meeting-notes-format#Meeting Notes Format":""},"title":"August 2025 Meetings"},"/project-docs/poc/":{"data":{"proof-of-concepts#Proof of Concepts":"Proof of ConceptsThis section contains documentation for prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations."},"title":"POCs"},"/project-docs/poc/feature-x-prototype/":{"data":{"feature-x-prototype#Feature X Prototype":"","how-to-document-pocs#How to Document POCs":"Feature X PrototypeThis section documents the Feature X proof of concept including:\nImplementation details Testing results Lessons learned Next steps How to Document POCs Use the POC template for consistency Include setup instructions Document results and conclusions Link to any code repositories "},"title":"Feature X Prototype"},"/project-docs/poc/integration-test-results/":{"data":{"integration-test-results#Integration Test Results":"","test-documentation-structure#Test Documentation Structure":"Integration Test ResultsThis section contains integration testing documentation including:\nTest execution reports Performance metrics Issue tracking and resolution Test automation documentation Test Documentation Structure Create reports using consistent naming: YYYY-MM-DD-test-name.md Include test scope, methodology, and results Document any issues found and their resolution Link to relevant code or test repositories "},"title":"Integration Test Results"},"/project-docs/research/":{"data":{"research-documentation#Research Documentation":"Research DocumentationThis section contains research documentation, market analysis, and technology evaluations."},"title":"Research"},"/project-docs/research/market-analysis/":{"data":{"how-to-add-content#How to Add Content":"Market AnalysisThis section contains market research documentation including:\nCompetitive analysis Market trends and insights User research findings Industry benchmarks How to Add Content Create new markdown files in this directory Use the research template for consistency Include relevant data, charts, and references ","market-analysis#Market Analysis":""},"title":"Market Analysis"},"/project-docs/research/technology-evaluations/":{"data":{"evaluation-process#Evaluation Process":"Technology EvaluationsThis section contains technical research and evaluations including:\nTechnology stack comparisons Library and framework evaluations Performance benchmarks Security assessments Evaluation Process Define evaluation criteria Research and test technologies Document findings using our research template Make recommendations based on findings ","technology-evaluations#Technology Evaluations":""},"title":"Technology Evaluations"}}
