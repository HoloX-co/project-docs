# Documentation Repository Strategy

## Repository Setup Recommendations

Creating a separate repository for project-wide documentation is an excellent approach. Here's a comprehensive strategy for setting it up effectively:

### Repository Structure

```
docs-repo/
├── README.md
├── decisions/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── ADR-0001-use-react-for-frontend.md
│   └── ADR-template.md
├── research/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── market-analysis/
│   └── technology-evaluations/
├── poc/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── feature-x-prototype/
│   └── integration-test-results/
├── architecture/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── diagrams/
│   └── system-overview.md
├── guides/
│   ├── onboarding.md
│   └── contribution.md
├── meetings/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── 2025-08/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
└── _templates/
    ├── decision-template.md
    └── research-template.md
```

## Key Components

### 1. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

````markdown name=decisions/ADR-template.md
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-NNNN](./ADR-NNNN.md)]

## Context
[Describe the problem/opportunity and the forces at play]

## Decision
[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context after applying the decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternative options that were considered and why they were not chosen]

## References
[Optional: List any relevant resources or related ADRs]
````

### 2. Research Documentation

For research results, use consistent formatting to make findings easy to discover:

````markdown name=_templates/research-template.md
# [Research Topic]

## Overview
Brief description of research objective

## Methodology
How the research was conducted

## Findings
Key discoveries and insights

## Recommendations
Actionable next steps based on findings

## References
- [Link to sources]
- [Link to related research]

## Appendix
Additional supporting materials
````

### 3. Proof of Concept Documentation

For POCs, document both the approach and results:

````markdown name=_templates/poc-template.md
# [POC Name]

## Objective
What this POC aims to validate or explore

## Implementation
Brief description of how the POC was implemented

## Setup Instructions
How to run/reproduce the POC

## Results
Outcomes, metrics, screenshots, etc.

## Conclusions
What we learned and next steps

## Code Repository
Link to any code created for this POC
````

## Advanced Organization Techniques

### 1. Tag-based Discovery

Implement a tagging system at the top of each document to improve cross-referencing:

```
---
title: "Feature X Evaluation"
date: 2025-08-10
tags: ["performance", "scalability", "frontend"]
related: ["ADR-0005", "Research-Database-Options"]
contributors: ["sepehrfazeli", "teammate1"]
---
```

### 2. Cross-Repository References

Create a dedicated section in your main README to link to important documentation in other repositories:

````markdown name=README.md
# Project Documentation

Central repository for project-wide documentation, decisions, research, and more.

## Related Repositories
- [Frontend](https://github.com/org/frontend) - Main application code
- [Backend](https://github.com/org/backend) - API and server implementation
- [Infrastructure](https://github.com/org/infrastructure) - Deployment and DevOps

## Quick Links
- [Architecture Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md)
- [Latest ADRs](./decisions/)
- [Onboarding Guide](./guides/onboarding.md)
````

## Recommended Tools & Integrations

1. **GitHub Pages** - Enable this to create a browsable website from your markdown documentation
2. **Docsify or MkDocs** - Lightweight documentation site generators that work well with GitHub
3. **Mermaid or PlantUML** - For embedding diagrams directly in markdown
4. **GitHub Actions** - For validating links, formatting, etc.
5. **DocToc** - For generating table of contents in markdown files

## Out-of-the-Box Insights

1. **Knowledge Graphs**: Consider implementing a visual knowledge graph that shows relationships between documents. Tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) can help visualize these connections.

2. **Living Documents**: Treat documentation as "living" - schedule regular reviews to keep content fresh. Consider adding "Last reviewed" dates to critical documents.

3. **Decision Logs**: Beyond ADRs, maintain a chronological decision log for smaller decisions that don't warrant a full ADR.

4. **Search Optimization**: GitHub's search is basic - consider implementing a custom search solution (e.g., Algolia) for your documentation site.

5. **Documentation Health Metrics**: Track documentation health with metrics like freshness, coverage, and usage. GitHub Actions can generate regular reports.

6. **Onboarding Pathways**: Create curated reading paths through your documentation for different roles to help new team members get up to speed.

7. **Discussion Integration**: Link GitHub Discussions to relevant documentation to capture evolving conversations about topics.

8. **Video Supplements**: For complex topics, consider embedding short explainer videos alongside written documentation.
